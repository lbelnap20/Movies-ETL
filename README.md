This is a function written to extract, transform, and load data from csv and json files. The function is built in four parts, with the finished function in [ETL_function_test.ipynb](https://github.com/lbelnap20/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_create_database.ipynb). It's main purpose is to filter out null, irrelevant, and bad data and merge two datasets into one easy to navigate data set. The finished products are uploaded into SQL files.
